A small c++ project that I did as part of CS300 (DSA) class.

The main idea of it is that it is a console course planner. It parses a CVS file that contains
course data then it allows a user to print available classes.

This project uses a BST internally to keep track of the classes. Also, I integrated a separate lib for parsing CVS files.
