* What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  * I had to choose a data structure that would work  for storing a list of college courses and their prereqs.  
* How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  * I tried to analyze pros and cons for each of the data structures offered. Picking the right one to work with
  is crucial because it could either make development easier or make it harder.
* How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  * I tried to use common sense and my judgment to interpret instructions of the assignments.
* How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  * It probably has not really expanded it very much since this is a very basic project, but it definitely helped me to
  brush up on some basic cpp ideas and syntax.
* How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  * It has helped me to pay more attention to refactoring of the existing code bases.
